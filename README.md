# Rustify

## Project Web Stack

Rustify is a full-stack web framework combining:

- **SolidStart** (frontend): A modern, reactive JavaScript framework for building fast and interactive UIs.
- **Salvo.rs** (backend): A powerful, async Rust web server framework for building robust APIs and web services.
- **Diesel ORM** (database): A safe, efficient Rust ORM for interacting with SQL databases using compile-time checked queries.

## How Rustify Helps Newbies Adopt Rust for Web Development

- **Clear Structure:** The project is organized with separate folders for models, controllers, and routes, following familiar MVC patterns.
- **Modern Tooling:** Uses popular, production-ready Rust libraries and a modern frontend stack, making it easy to learn best practices.
- **.env Integration:** Environment variables are managed in a `.env` file, similar to other web frameworks, simplifying configuration.
- **Demo Code:** Includes example routes and models to help beginners understand how to build APIs and connect to databases.
- **Type Safety:** Rust’s strong type system and Diesel’s compile-time query checks help prevent common bugs and improve reliability.
- **Documentation:** The README and code comments guide new users through setup and usage, lowering the barrier to entry.

Rustify is designed to be a practical starting point for anyone new to Rust web development, making it easier to build, understand, and scale web applications with confidence.
